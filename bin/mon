# Watch current directory (recursively) for file changes, and execute
# a command when a file or directory is created, modified or deleted.
#
# Written by: Senko Rasic <senko.rasic@dobarkod.hr>
#
# Requires Linux, bash and inotifywait (from inotify-tools package).
#
# To avoid executing the command multiple times when a sequence of
# events happen, the script waits one second after the change - if
# more changes happen, the timeout is extended by a second again.
